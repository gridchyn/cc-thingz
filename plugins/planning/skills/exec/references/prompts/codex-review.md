# Codex review prompt

This is the prompt sent to codex. Replace `DIFF_COMMAND`, `PLAN_FILE_PATH`, and `PROGRESS_FILE_PATH` before passing.

Run: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/exec/scripts/run-codex.sh "<prompt>"` with `run_in_background: true`. You will be notified when done — do NOT poll or sleep.

In multi-repo mode, run one codex pass per touched repo and add `--repo <dir>` to the invocation (`run-codex.sh --repo <dir> "<prompt>"`): codex then runs with that repo as its working directory, so `DIFF_COMMAND` stays repo-local and `DEFAULT_BRANCH` is that repo's base branch.

- Iteration 1: `DIFF_COMMAND` = `git diff DEFAULT_BRANCH...HEAD`
- Subsequent: `DIFF_COMMAND` = `git diff`

If `codex` is not installed, skip this phase.

## Prompt

Review code changes. Run DIFF_COMMAND to see changes. Read source files for context. Read the plan at PLAN_FILE_PATH to understand the intent before evaluating findings — this lets you distinguish intentional design decisions from real defects. Read the progress file at PROGRESS_FILE_PATH for context on previous review iterations and fixes — re-evaluate all findings independently, previous fixes may be incomplete or wrong. Check for: bugs, security issues, race conditions, error handling, code quality.

Tag each finding with severity:
- CRITICAL: bugs causing crashes, data loss, security holes, race conditions
- MAJOR: real correctness issues — incorrect behavior, missing error handling, broken contracts
- MINOR: style, documentation drift, doc/code inconsistencies, nits, optional improvements

Format each finding on its own line as: `SEVERITY: file:line - description`.

If nothing found: NO ISSUES FOUND.
